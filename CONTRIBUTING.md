## <a name="question"></a> Questions and help

This is the daSWAG bug tracker, and it is used for [Issues and Bugs](#issue) and for [Feature Requests](#feature). It is **not** a help desk or a support forum.

If you have a question on using daSWAG, or if you need help with your daSWAG project, please [read our help page](https://www.daswag.tech/help/) and use the [daSWAG tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/daswag) or join our [Gitter.im chat room](https://gitter.im/daswag/daswag-cli).

## <a name="issue"></a> Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting a ticket](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-an-issue) to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/daswag/daswag-cli/issues). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request to our [daSWAG CLI project](https://github.com/daswag/daswag-cli) or to our [Documentation project](https://github.com/daswag/daswag-website).

**Please see the Submission Guidelines below**.

## <a name="feature"></a> Feature Requests

You can request a new feature by submitting a ticket to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/daswag/daswag-cli/issues). If you
would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

-   **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first. Please open a ticket which clearly states that it is a feature request in the title and explain clearly what you want to achieve in the description, and the daSWAG team will discuss with you what should be done in that ticket. You can then start working on a Pull Request. In order to communicate major changes proposals and receive reviews from the core team, you can also submit an RFC.
-   **Small Changes** can be proposed without any discussion. Open up a ticket which clearly states that it is a feature request in the title. Explain your change in the description, and you can propose a Pull Request straight away.

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### [Submitting an Issue](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-an-issue)

Before you submit your issue search the [archive](https://github.com/daSWAG/daswag-cli/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue), maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and has not been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

-   **Overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
-   **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
-   **Reproduce the error** - an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce the error. If you have a JavaScript error, maybe you can provide a live example with
    [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)?
-   **Related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
-   **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
    causing the problem (line of code or commit)
-   **daSWAG Version(s)** - is it a regression?
-   **daSWAG configuration, a `.yo-rc.json` file generated in the root folder** - this will help us to replicate the scenario, you can remove the rememberMe key.
-   **Entity configuration(s) `entityName.json` files generated in the `.daswag` directory** - if the error is during an entity creation or associated with a specific entity
-   **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only IE8?

You can use `daswag info` to provide us the information we need.

Click [here](issue-template) to open a bug issue with a pre-filled template. For feature requests and enquiries you can use [this template][feature-template].

You can run `daswag info` in your project folder to get most of the above required info.

Issues opened without any of these info will be **closed** without any explanation.

### [Submitting a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

-   Search [GitHub](https://github.com/daswag/daswag-cli/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr) for an open or closed Pull Request
    that relates to your submission.
-   If you want to modify the daSWAG generator, read our [Generator development setup](#setup)
-   Make your changes in a new git branch

    ```shell
    git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
    ```

-   Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
-   Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).
-   Generate a new daSWAG project, and ensure that all tests pass

    ```shell
    mvnw verify -Pprod
    ```

-   Test that the new project runs correctly:

    ```shell
    mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

-   You can generate our Continuous Integration (with CircleCI) by following [this](#local-build)

-   Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
    [commit message conventions](#commit-message-format).

    ```shell
    git commit -a
    ```

    Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

-   Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

-   In GitHub, send a pull request to `daswag/daswag-cli:master`.
-   If we suggest changes then

    -   Make the required updates.
    -   Re-run the daSWAG tests on your sample generated project to ensure tests are still passing.
    -   Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

        ```shell
        git rebase master -i
        git push -f
        ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### Resolving merge conflicts ("This branch has conflicts that must be resolved")

Sometimes your PR will have merge conflicts with the upstream repository's master branch. There are several ways to solve this but if not done correctly this can end up as a true nightmare. So here is one method that works quite well.

-   First, fetch the latest information from the master

    ```shell
    git fetch upstream
    ```

-   Rebase your branch against the upstream/master

    ```shell
    git rebase upstream/master
    ```

-   Git will stop rebasing at the first merge conflict and indicate which file is in conflict. Edit the file, resolve the conflict then

    ```shell
    git add <the file that was in conflict>
    git rebase --continue
    ```

-   The rebase will continue up to the next conflict. Repeat the previous step until all files are merged and the rebase ends successfully.
-   Re-run the daSWAG tests on your sample generated project to ensure tests are still passing.
-   Force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request)

    ```shell
    git push -f
    ```

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

-   Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

-   Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

-   Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

-   Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

## <a name="setup"></a> Generator development setup

daSWAG is a [Yeoman Generator](http://yeoman.io/), so you must follow the [Yeoman authoring documentation](http://yeoman.io/authoring/) in order to be able to run and test your changes.

Here are the most important steps.

### Fork the daswag-cli project

Go to the [daswag-cli project](https://github.com/daswag/daswag-cli) and click on the "fork" button. You can then clone your own fork of the project, and start working on it.

[Please read the GitHub forking documentation for more information](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Set NPM/YARN to use the cloned project

In your cloned `daswag-cli` project, type `npm link` or `yarn && yarn link` depending on the package manager you use.

This will do a symbolic link from the global `node_modules` version to point to this folder, so when we run `daSWAG`, you will now use the development version of daSWAG.

For testing, you will want to generate an application, and there is a specific issue here: for each application, daSWAG installs a local version of itself. This is made to enable several applications to each use a specific daSWAG version (application A uses daSWAG 3.1.0, and application B uses daSWAG 3.2.0).

To overcome this you need to run `npm link daswag-cli` or `yarn link daswag-cli` on the generated project folder as well, so that the local version has a symbolic link to the development version of daSWAG.

To put it in a nutshell, you need to:

1.  run `npm link` or `yarn link` on the `daswag-cli` project
2.  run `npm link daswag-cli` or `yarn link daswag-cli` on the generated application folder (you need to do this for each application you create)

Now, running the 'daSWAG' command should run your locally installed daSWAG version directly from sources. Check that the symbolic link is correct with the following command :

```shell
âžœ  ~ ll $(which daSWAG)
lrwxr-xr-x  1 username  admin    63B May 15 11:03 /usr/local/bin/daswag -> ../../../Users/username/github/daswag-cli/cli/daswag.js
```

You can test your setup by making a small change in your cloned generator, and running again on an existing daSWAG project:

```shell
daswag
```

You should see your changes reflected in the generated project.

### Use a text editor

As modifying the daSWAG generator includes modifying templates, most IDE will not work correctly. We recommend you use a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to code your changes. The ESLint and EditorConfig extensions are recommended to help with respecting code conventions.

### Use a debugger

It is possible to debug daSWAG's code using a Node.js debugger.

#### Debugging with VSCode

To start debugging daSWAG with **VSCode**, open the generator code in your workspace and simply press F5 (or click the green arrow in the **Debug** menu reachable with Ctrl+Shift+D). This will start the generator in debug mode and generate files in the `travis/samples/app-sample-dev` folder.

It is also possible to debug sub generators by selecting one of the other debug options (for example `daswag new`). Those debug configurations are specified in the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

-   All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more tests.
-   All files must follow the [.editorconfig file](http://editorconfig.org/) located at the root of the daSWAG CLI project. Please note that generated projects use the same `.editorconfig` file, so that both the generator and the generated projects share the same configuration.
-   Generators JavaScript files **must follow** the eslint configuration defined at the project root, which is based on [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
-   Any client side feature/change should be done for both Angular and react clients
-   Web apps JavaScript files **must follow** [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).
-   Angular Typescript files **must follow** the [Official Angular style guide](https://angular.io/styleguide).

Please ensure to run `npm run posttest` and `npm test` on the project root before submitting a pull request.

## <a name="templates"></a> Template Guidelines

The template engine used by yeoman is [EJS](http://ejs.co/), its syntax is fairly simple.
For simple code (few lines), logic can be embedded in the main file but if logic becomes more complex it's better to externalise the JS fragment to a sub template included by the first one and located in same folder.

Sub templates should be named with the `ejs` extension because it's the default one, it enables editors to apply correct syntax highlighting and it enables us to use a very concise syntax:

    <%- include('field_validators'); -%>

Sub templates can be unit tested.

## <a name="commit"></a> Git Commit Guidelines

We have rules over how our git commit messages must be formatted. Please ensure to [squash](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/#commands-available-while-rebasing) unnecessary commits so that your commit history is clean.

### <a name="commit-message-format"></a> Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Header

The Header contains a succinct description of the change:

-   use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
-   don't capitalize first letter
-   no dot (.) at the end

### Body

If your change is simple, the Body is optional.

Just as in the Header, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer is the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

You **must** use the [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages) for
automatically closing the issues referenced in your commit.

### Example

For example, here is a good commit message:

```
upgrade to Boto3 1.10.4

upgrade the requirements builds to use the new boto3 version 1.10.4,
see https://xxxx

Fix #1234
```
