This is a daSWAG template for your User Management authentication system.

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with at least PowerUser permission

## Setup process

### Deployment

Firstly, we need a technical user used to deploy your stack following the `Least Privilege principle` - If you don't have a technical user to deploy your user management component then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
make deploy-init
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy all your user management component resources.

```bash
make deploy
```

> **See [daSWAG HOWTO Guide] for more details on daSWAG user management component integration.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
make output
```

## Production

By default all your resources are going to be built for a development environment. If you need to deploy to other stage, you simply need to add a `STAGE_NAME=your-env` parameters on each previous command.

For example to deploy into production you will have:

```bash
make deploy STAGE_NAME=prod

make output STAGE_NAME=prod
```

## daSWAG CLI commands

daSWAG CLI commands to deploy and describe outputs defined within the cloudformation stack:

```bash

make deploy

make output

```
