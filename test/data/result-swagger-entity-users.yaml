    ## Overview
    This is the backend API which is used by the clients to talk to the
    backend services.
    All the API endpoints are HTTPS only and require authentication through dedicated identity provider.
    The API is deployed to [AWS API
    Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), with each endpoint mapped to
    a dedicated [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function.
    It is meant to be as
    [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) as
    possible, however some specificities due to using AWS and the constant
    evolution of the product might appear. They are documented when applicable.
    ## Conventions
    ### HTTP Methods
      - Retrieving an item is done via the GET method, and returns either an object, specific properties from an object, or a `message` object reponse.
      - Adding a new item is done via the POST method, and returns the id of the object created.
      - Editing/Updating an item is done via the PUT method, and returns the full object.
      - Deleting an item is done via the DELETE method, and returns a `message` object.
    ### The `message` object
      The `message` object is used to return a standard response to API operations that result in a boolean, and for all the error messages.
